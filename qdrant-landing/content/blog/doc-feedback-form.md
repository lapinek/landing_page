Hello, Qdrant community! We are pleased to announce a new feature that can help
us give you better documentation - a feedback form. This form is a crucial step
in our effort to customize our documentation to meet your needs. Your insights
and experiences as users are invaluable to us, and we want to hear from you!

## Why your feedback is important

When most people look at software, they start with the documentation. It guides
new users through available features. It serves as the reference for experienced
users. However, keeping documentation up-to-date and relevant is an ongoing
challenge. That's why we've implemented a feedback form on each page of our
Qdrant documentation.

## The process

As you read our documentation, you can find a feedback form towards the lower-
right part of each page: "Was this page helpful?" To answer, select 
"Yes" or "No."

### If you select "Yes"

You've made our day! More importantly, we get substantive data that tells us
that the specific doc page has actually helped you.

![If you select "Yes", we thank you](/blog/doc-feedback-option/feedback_like.png)

### If you select "No"

If you select "no," we provide links to:

- Edit this page on GitHub
- Create a GitHub issue

In the spirit of open source, we encourage you to use these links. Help us
help you with better documentation. Alternatively, you can always create
an issue or submit a pull request directly in the relevant GitHub
repository, https://github.com/qdrant/landing_page.

![If you select "No," we ask for your help](/blog/doc-feedback-option/feedback_dislike.png)

## Data-driven improvements

All responses are sent to Google Analytics. This data helps us understand
what parts of our documentation need our attention. All Yes/No answers are
anonymous. If you choose to propose an edit or create an issue, we do
see the GitHub account that you're using.

We look forward to your feedback!
